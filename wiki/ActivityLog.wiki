This page holds the unofficial ToDo List / Activity Log for libusb-winusb


== MAIN ==

  * Add elementary HID (non WinUSB) handling so that we get the feel of how APIs should be broken down => without interface and endpoint access through HID layer, not sure how far we can get
  * Detect WinUSB during enum to prevent WinUSB calls on non WinUSB devives `[`DONE using driver string: 2009.12.13`]`
  * Detect driverless devices during enum for future automated WinUSB driver addon


== EXTRAS ==

  * hotplug

== BUGFIXES ==

  * deviceless external hub random failure on descriptors. Is there anything we can do?
