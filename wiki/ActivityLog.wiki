MAIN:
o detect WinUSB during enum to prevent WinUSB calls on non WinUSB devives [DONE using driver string: 2009.12.13]
o detect driverless devices during enum for future automated WinUSB driver addon
  - conn_info.CurrentConfigurationValue false => priv->driver = "no_driver" [DONE: 2009.12.14]
o actually read active configuration from conn_info [DONE: 2009.12.15]
o comment the inf with regards to CoInstallers' choice and add provision for Multiple Interfaces (MI_##)
o xusb winusb test application
  - add string I/O to xusb [DONE: 2009.12.15]
o async (polled/overlapped) I/O
  - crude poll using OVERLAPPED pointers as fds + HasOverlappedIoCompleted [DONE: 2009.12.16]
  - control transfers [DON]
  - retrieve actual length [DONE: 2009.12.16]
  - bulk/interrupt
o the never ending multiple interfaces handling
  - generic readout of registry keys and values [DONE: 2009.12.18]
  - retrieve full device path from HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\DeviceClasses\* [DONE: 2009.12.18]
  - WinUSB interface selection through MI_## [DONE: 2009.12.18]
o poll & pipe redesign
  - support for control fd ("fish in the pipe") [(actually) DONE: 2009.12.22]
  - overlapped support all the way [DONE: 2009.12.22]
o better/multiple API handling (refer to libusb-win32-v1) [API_CALL macro - DONE: 2009.12.18]
o sanitize_path & windows_error_string improvements [DONE: 2009.12.18]
o test on WinXP
o multithreading

EXTRAS:
o add elementary HID (non WinUSB) handling so that we get the feel of how APIs should be broken down 
  => without interface and endpoint access through HID layer, not sure how far we can get
o hotplug
o automated driver installation. requires: (install will need to  - is that doable easily?)
  - proper detection on driverless devices (code 28?)
  - detection of composite devices and (in the current MI_##-less scheme) "upgrade" of usbccgp.sys to WinUSB
o is there a way to disable google's annoying <pre> colouring on this wiki?
o use usbi list functions for our hcd chained list

BUGFIXES:
o deviceless external hub random failure on descriptors. Is there anything we can do?
  => check what's happening on the bus
o SetupDI### call enumerates composite devices at the root ("usbccgp") rather than the leaves ("WinUSB") 
  => trying to obtain the FULL path (i.e. path that works with CreateFile) of the WinUSB leaves of a composite device handled by usbccgp is an absolute nightmare! 
     For now, just replace the composite driver with a WinUSB one. Install is a pain (must force upgrade), but it works. ["FIXED": 2009.12.16]
o Well, above doesn't work for interface selection through WinUsb_GetAssociatedInterface (what the ???)
  => back to the (more versatile) separate MI_## for composite devices' interfaces ["RE-FIXED": 2009.12.17]
o poll says control fd overlapped IO complete [FIXED with a "poll we can believe in": 2009.12.22]
